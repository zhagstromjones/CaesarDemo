CaesarDemo.py

This program demonstrates a Caesar cipher to provide a basic encryption for a string of text. The Caesar cipher works by "shifting" the plaintext character code of each character in a string by an amount defined by the user and displays the resulting ciphertext. The user inputs a message as well as the amount desired to shift the characters. The resulting ciphertext is then output to the user.
